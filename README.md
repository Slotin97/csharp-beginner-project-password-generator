This code is a simple password generator application that allows the user to generate a number of passwords with a specified length.

The program uses C# and the Random class to generate random characters from a predefined set of characters (passChars) and concatenates them to form the password.
The application prompts the user to input the number of passwords to be generated, and the length of each password.

The program performs input validation to ensure that only valid numbers are entered. The generated passwords are stored in a list and are then displayed to the user.
The program uses a combination of while loops and if-else statements to control the flow of the program and handle input validation.
